            <p>TODO: update this for new context</p><p style=""></p><p style="">Out Of Phase II - Music Synthesis & Composition Software</p><p style=""></p><p style="">It lives...</p><p style=""></p><p style="">Web site: http://outofphasemusic.com/</p><p style=""></p><p style="">Out Of Phase was an ancient program I wrote for music synthesis and sequencing in the [now called] EDM genre. It ran on the pre-Intel, pre-OSX Macintosh, from 1994 to 2002. Once OSX came out, it was on life support, and with the switch to Intel processors it ceased to run on any modern hardware.</p><p style=""></p><p style="">The original was started at the Undergraduate Projects Laboratory of the University of Wisconsin (see <a href="http://www.upl.cs.wisc.edu/ ">http://www.upl.cs.wisc.edu/</a>), and "finished" while I was at graduate school at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. It's still referenced from the UPL archived projects page: <a href="http://www.upl.cs.wisc.edu/Projects/Archive">http://www.upl.cs.wisc.edu/Projects/Archive</a>. For example, version 1.31 from 1997 is referenced here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971010072440/http://www.upl.cs.wisc.edu/cold/code/">https://web.archive.org/web/19971010072440/http://www.upl.cs.wisc.edu/cold/code/</a>. Unfortunately, Archive.org did not capture the server that contained the actual source and binaries.</p><p style=""></p><p style="">The program mostly disappeared from view. (Mysteriously, there is still a public reference after all these years here: <a href="http://www.hitsquad.com/smm/programs/Out_Of_Phase/">http://www.hitsquad.com/smm/programs/Out_Of_Phase/</a>; unfortunately the download link there does not work either.) The source code laid dormant on my hard drive for 12 years until I missed it enough that I decided to resurrect it. The first recurrence will be running on the Microsoft .NET platform as a WinForms application, as that is the closest match to the old pre-OSX Macintosh GUI layer. However, WPF would enable many scenarios I have in mind to add to this new edition. Choosing the .NET platform was a difficult choice as it is somewhat risky for a performance-oriented application, but it enables multiplatform portability and ease of development in a powerful way.</p><p style=""></p><p style="">The source code of the last working Macintosh version (tentatively called 2.1) is stored in the .zip file "Original Macintosh Version - Source.zip" as a reference.</p><p></p>
