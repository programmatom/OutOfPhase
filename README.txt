Out Of Phase II - Music Synthesis Software

It lives...

Out Of Phase was an ancient program I wrote for music synthesis and sequencing in the [now called] EDM genre. It ran on the pre-Intel, pre-OSX Macintosh, from 1994 to 2002. Once OSX came out, it was on life support, and with the switch to Intel processors it ceased to run on any modern hardware.

The original was started at the Undergraduate Projects Laboratory of the University of Wisconsin (see http://www.upl.cs.wisc.edu/ ), and "finished" while I was at graduate school at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. It's still referenced from the UPL archived projects page: http://www.upl.cs.wisc.edu/Projects/Archive . For example, version 1.31 from 1997 is referenced here: https://web.archive.org/web/19971010072440/http://www.upl.cs.wisc.edu/cold/code/ . Unfortunately, Archive.org did not capture the server that contained the actual source and binaries.

The program mostly disappeared from view. (Mysteriously, there is still a public reference after all these years here: http://www.hitsquad.com/smm/programs/Out_Of_Phase/ ; unfortunately the download link there does not work either.) The source code laid dormant on my hard drive for 12 years until I missed it enough that I decided to resurrect it. The first recurrence will be running on the Microsoft .NET platform as a WinForms application, as that is the closest match to the old pre-OSX Macintosh GUI layer. However, WPF would enable many scenarios I have in mind to add to this new edition. Choosing the .NET platform was a difficult choice as it is somewhat risky for a performance-oriented application, but it enables multiplatform portability and ease of development in a powerful way.

The source code of the last working Macintosh version (tentatively called 2.1) is stored in the .zip file "Original Macintosh Version - Source.zip" as a reference.
